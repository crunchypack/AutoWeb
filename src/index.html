            <p class="large-p">Threepio! Come in, Threepio! Threepio! Get to the top! I can't Where could he be?
                Threepio! Threepio, will you come in? They aren't here! Something must have happened to them. See if
                they've been captured. Hurry! One thing's for sure. We're all going to be a lot thinner! Get on top of
                it! I'm trying! Thank goodness, they haven't found them! Where could they be? Use the comlink? Oh, my!
                I forgot I turned it off! Are you there, sir? Threepio! We've had some problems... Will you shut up and
                listen to me? Shut down all garbage mashers on the detention level, will you? Do you copy? Shut down
                all the garbage mashers on the detention level. Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention
                level. No. Shut them all down! Hurry! Listen to them! They're dying, Artoo! Curse my metal body! I
                wasn't fast enough. It's all my fault! My poor master! Threepio, we're all right! We're all right. You
                did great.</p>
            <p class="large-p">It looks like Sandpeople did this, all right. Look, here are Gaffi sticks, Bantha
                tracks. It's just...I never heard of them hitting anything this big before. They didn't. But we are
                meant to think they did. These tracks are side by side. Sandpeople always ride single file to hide
                there numbers. These are the same Jawas that sold us Artoo and Threepio. And these blast points, too
                accurate for Sandpeople. Only Imperial stormtroopers are so precise. Why would Imperial troops want to
                slaughter Jawas? If they traced the robots here, they may have learned who they sold them to. And that
                would lead them home! Wait, Luke! It's too dangerous. Uncle Owen! Aunt Beru! Uncle Owen!</p>

            <p class="small-p">Well, that's the trick, isn't it? And it's going to cost you something extra. Ten
                thousand in advance. Ten thousand? We could almost buy our own ship for that! But who's going to fly
                it, kid! You? You bet I could. I'm not such a bad pilot myself! We don't have to sit here and listen...
                We haven't that much with us. But we could pay you two thousand now, plus fifteen when we reach
                Alderaan. Seventeen, huh! Okay. You guys got yourself a ship. We'll leave as soon as you're ready.
                Docking bay Ninety-four. Ninety-four. Looks like somebody's beginning to take an interest in your
                handiwork. All right, we'll check it out.</p>
            <p class="small-p">Orbiting the planet at maximum velocity. The moon with the Rebel base will be in range
                in thirty minutes. This will be a day long remembered. It has seen the end of Kenobi and it will soon
                see the end of the Rebellion. The approach will not be easy. You are required to maneuver straight down
                this trench and skim the surface to this point. The target area is only two meters wide. It's a small
                thermal exhaust port, right below the main port. The shaft leads directly to the reactor system. A
                precise hit will start a chain reaction which should destroy the station. Only a precise hit will set
                up a chain reaction. The shaft is ray-shielded, so you'll have to use proton torpedoes. That's
                impossible, even for a computer. It's not impossible. I used to bull's-eye womp rats in my T-sixteen
                back home. They're not much bigger than two meters. Man your ships! And may the Force be with you!</p>

        <div class="secondary">
            <p>We've entered the Alderaan system. Governor Tarkin, I should have expected to find you holding Vader's
                leash. I recognized your foul stench when I was brought on board. Charming to the last. You don't know
                how hard I found it signing the order to terminate your life! I surprised you had the courage to take
                the responsibility yourself! Princess Leia, before your execution I would like you to be my guest at a
                ceremony that will make this battle station operational. No star system will dare oppose the Emperor
                now. The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.</p>
            <p>What is it? I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir. He says I found her, and keeps repeating, She's here.
                Well, who...who has he found? Princess Leia. The princess? She's here? Princess? What's going on? Level
                five. Detention block A A-twenty-three. I'm afraid she's scheduled to be terminated. Oh, no! We've got
                to do something. What are you talking about? The droid belongs to her. She's the one in the message..
                We've got to help her. Now, look, don't get any funny ideas. The old man wants us to wait right here.
                But he didn't know she was here. Look, will you just find a way back into the detention block?</p>

                check it out.</p>
            <p>Here they come! They're coming in too fast! Oooh! We've lost lateral controls. Don't worry, she'll hold
                together. You hear me, baby? Hold together! Got him! I got him! Great kid! Don't get cocky. There are
                still two more of them out there! That's it! We did it! We did it! Help! I think I'm melting! This is
                all your fault.

            </p>
            <p>To your stations! Come with me. Close all outboard shields! Close all outboard shields! Yes. We've
                captured a freighter entering the remains of the Alderaan system. It's markings match those of a ship
                that blasted its way out of Mos Eisley. They must be trying to return the stolen plans to the princess.
                She may yet be of some use to us. Unlock one-five-seven and nine. Release charges. There's no one on
                board, sir. According to the log, the crew abandoned ship right after takeoff. It must be a decoy, sir.
                Several of the escape pods have been jettisoned.
